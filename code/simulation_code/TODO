Use FMNIST and CIFAR10 -> DONE (both datasets can now be imported)
Implement non-iid split -> DONE 
Fix non-iid case -> DONE  + Checked with all MNIST, FMNIST, CIFAR10
Implement FCN for centralized FMNIST -> Done FMNIST (although using CNN w/ 2 conv layers)
Implement CNN for CIFAR10 -> DONE (need to use Adam optimizer though)
Implement attacks centralized -> DONE
Run simulations -> TODO (ongoing)
Implement decentralized -> DONE (but need to fix non-iid)
    - Increase local epoch number - try 2, 5
    - See what happens when incresase number of communications rounds try 500
Finish writing proofs in notebook -> DONE
Look at centrality + attacks -> TODO WIP
Continue writing literature review on Overleaf -> DONE
Look over other proofs -> TODO WIP
Decentralized + 1 adversarial + consider centrality + undirected + DFedAvg (assume matrix to be doubly stochastic) -> TODO
Implement the changes to centrality:
- Firstly, save as folders on files -> DONE
- Save the adjacency matrix -> DONE (also random adjacency matrix generation)
- Save the accuracy for all clients -> DONE
- Check different centralities
    - Implement measuring different centralities -> DONE, using networkx
    - Generate networks at random -> DONE for iid, for non-iid depends on the sizes of other dsets (still random)
    - See which centrality affects the accuracy most for all clients -> TODO
        - Consider different kinds of centralities (for simulations), eigenvector centrality for theoretical (also the only one closely relating )
        - Rank the nodes in order of centrality for every measure of centrality, focus on top k central nodes and attack them 
        - Then look at the effect on the convergence rate/accuracy decrease
        - Identify if there is a critical number of nodes that need to be attack to reduce testing accuracy 
        - Plot degredation of the testing accuracy as the number of attack nodes (top k nodes)
- Look at the epidemic spread (accuracy loss spread over the network)
- See different topologies, how the adjacency matrix affects the process, discuss with shryiar
