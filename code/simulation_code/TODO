# Use FMNIST and CIFAR10 -> DONE (both datasets can now be imported)
# Implement non-iid split -> DONE 
# Fix non-iid case -> DONE  + Checked with all MNIST, FMNIST, CIFAR10
# Implement FCN for centralized FMNIST -> Done FMNIST (although using CNN w/ 2 conv layers)
# Implement CNN for CIFAR10 -> DONE (need to use Adam optimizer though)
# Implement attacks centralized -> DONE
# Run simulations -> TODO (ongoing)
# Implement decentralized -> TODO
# Add graphviz for decentralized -> TODO
# Finish writing proofs in notebook -> TODO WIP
# Look at centrality + attacks -> TODO WIP
# Continue writing literature review on Overleaf -> TODO WIP
# Look over other proofs -> TODO WIP
# Decentralized + 1 adversarial + consider centrality + undirected + DFedAvg (assume matrix to be doubly stochastic) -> TODO
