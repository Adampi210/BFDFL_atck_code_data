- Run experiments for different non-iid degrees - running now
- Varying attack strength cases - include it.
- A few more cases for the size (more for lower num of adversaries, also add ER graphs) - include it.
- Run node failure experiments
    - generate network -> then run attack algorithm -> some nodes fail first -> train
    - alternatively: different nodes fail at different epochs
- Run experiments for link failure with an outage probability which depends on badnwidth factors
    - generate network -> then run attack algorithm -> some links fail ->train
    - alternatively: different links fail at different epochs
- Use the degree for choosing nodes, run experiment - include it
- exps using the new dataset - try but at the end.
